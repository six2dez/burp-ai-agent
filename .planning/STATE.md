# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-13)

**Core value:** Bring modern AI to a real security workflow without leaking sensitive traffic to third-party providers — privacy controls and an audit trail are non-negotiable, AI capability is additive.
**Current focus:** Phase 08 — BApp Store resubmission — MCP pivot to extension-native tools + compliance fixes

## Current Position

Phase: 08 (BApp Store resubmission — MCP pivot to extension-native tools + compliance fixes) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 4
Status: Executing Phase 08

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Active milestone scoped to v0.7.0 stabilization (Unreleased features + open bugs + docs + release).
- Init: Codebase mapping skipped — `SPEC.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` already capture architecture.
- Init: Domain research skipped — maintainer is the domain expert.
- Roadmap: Three feature audits (Perplexity, insertion-point, prompt library) split into independent parallel-safe phases; release cut isolated as Phase 6 choke point.

### Roadmap Evolution

- 2026-05-27: Phase 7 added — Proxy Transport + MCP Scope Hardening (closes GitHub issue #69; parallel-safe with Phases 1, 4, 5; must merge before Phase 6).
- 2026-05-28: Phase 8 added — BApp Store resubmission (MCP pivot to extension-native tools + `-PstoreBuild` gate, gate all AI calls on `ai.isEnabled()`, migrate passive scanning to `ScanCheck.passiveAudit()`, confirm name). Addresses PortSwigger review feedback on issue #231; follows Phase 07. Approved plan seed: ~/.claude/plans/drifting-hatching-sphinx.md.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- GitHub issue #62 (release pipeline publishes stale code) gates the v0.7.0 release; Phase 4 must close before Phase 6 can ship.
