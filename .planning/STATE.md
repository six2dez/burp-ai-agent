# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-13)

**Core value:** Bring modern AI to a real security workflow without leaking sensitive traffic to third-party providers — privacy controls and an audit trail are non-negotiable, AI capability is additive.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Active milestone scoped to v0.7.0 stabilization (Unreleased features + open bugs + docs + release).
- Init: Codebase mapping skipped — `SPEC.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` already capture architecture.
- Init: Domain research skipped — maintainer is the domain expert.
- Roadmap: Three feature audits (Perplexity, insertion-point, prompt library) split into independent parallel-safe phases; release cut isolated as Phase 6 choke point.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- GitHub issue #62 (release pipeline publishes stale code) gates the v0.7.0 release; Phase 4 must close before Phase 6 can ship.
- GitHub issue #66 (openai-compatible usage error) is a reported regression that should be folded into the release notes once fixed.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:
